## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

This was a quick, easy project I wanted to knock out after work. I played with Sass a bit more and enjoyed a few extra positioning challenges, but for the most part I used fixed heights, widths, and positioning since it's not a responsive project.
